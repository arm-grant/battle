# seeker Bones Store

The seeker Bones Store is a hub within the Battle seekers universe. Originating as the first place you could get your hands on a Battle seeker, Solomon has expanded the shop. What started as a seeker scrap yard is now where you can come to do a multitude of things. You can:

* View your Battle seeker avatars, compare stats and try out different looks
* Customise your Battle seeker with parts you own and confirm them on-chain
* Buy new seeker parts as they become available
* Sell your Battle seeker avatar on the open marketplace
* Collect and sell specific seeker parts to form a collection
* Trade seekers and/or parts with other community members

All of this makes the seeker Bones store one of the key features of our ecosystem and one which you will interact with frequently.
