# Drone Bones Store

The Drone Bones Store is a hub within the Battle Drones universe. Originating as the first place you could get your hands on a Battle Drone, Solomon has expanded the shop. What started as a drone scrap yard is now where you can come to do a multitude of things. You can:

* View your Battle Drone avatars, compare stats and try out different looks
* Customise your Battle Drone with parts you own and confirm them on-chain
* Buy new drone parts as they become available
* Sell your Battle Drone avatar on the open marketplace
* Collect and sell specific drone parts to form a collection
* Trade drones and/or parts with other community members

All of this makes the Drone Bones store one of the key features of our ecosystem and one which you will interact with frequently.
