# Battle Seekers Universe: a Deep Dive

The Battle Seekers **** universe is set in a fictional, alternate version of Earth where global superpowers battle for supremacy.

The nation-states and other major players in this fictional universe use Battle Seekers as the primary means of warfare and advancing their interests. Battle Seekers generally have a limited degree of autonomy and require a living, sentient pilot (human or otherwise) to operate them. The exception would be the AI-based A-EYE Seekers which are fully autonomous.

A global conflict that came to be known as the Seeker Wars wreaked great destruction across the planet, setting the stage for the events in [Battle ](https://docs.battleseekers.io/whitepaper/red-rock-resistance-debut-game-title/game-details)Seekers[:  blue screen Resistance](https://docs.battleseekers.io/whitepaper/red-rock-resistance-debut-game-title/game-details) and beyond.

More importantly, this conflict fueled the Seekers arms race. As tensions between nations escalated, the demand for better Seeker technology grew exponentially. As such, Seeker manufacturers around the world pioneered many innovations that would still be felt decades after.

In the year 2031, the United Territories of America (UTA) military launched a long-range missile strike on a Seekers carrier over the Atlantic Ocean. Unbeknownst to the UTA at the time, the carrier was housing two thermonuclear warheads, resulting in a catastrophic nuclear explosion. This subsequently leveled a significant portion of landmass off the coast of Eurasia, essentially wiping it off the map.

This was this pivotal moment that set the Seekers Wars in motion.

The Seekers carrier belonged to the Republic of the Flaming Metal Fists (FMF), formally known as Caspia, led by political outsider Akim Kebob. They responded by developing large-scale production of Seekers and weaponry to leverage against the UTA. They contracted private corporations such as Celerity as part of the war effort.

Meanwhile, the UTA quickly mobilized its forces and strategically built outposts at key locations across the globe. Not only did it intend to protect itself from reprisals, but also to safeguard its long-term interests. As a result, the UTA was also in a hurry to push the limits of its Seeker technology through intense research and development. KJ Dynamics, a UTA-based corporation, stepped up as the primary manufacturer and supplier of UTASeekers.

On the East Asian front, Japan also became part of the arms race. Kentaro Industries spearheaded the East Asian Empire’s efforts to improve its Seeker technology. Before the events leading up to the war, Japan had already sent Kentaro scientists and government officials to Eurasia and the UTA under the guise of diplomacy. In reality, the Empire wanted to study their technology so they could incorporate it into their native Seekers prototypes.

Thanks to reports provided by their covert intelligence agency, the Empire knew about the possibility of an impending war beforehand. Thus, they saw it fit to prepare and be in the best position to defend their territories.

Sure enough, the UTA launched an attack on East Asian territories and its military forces in 2033.

In light of these events, East Asia officially formed an alliance with the FMF and the rest of Eurasia.

This prompted the Empire to double its military efforts. Kentaro Industries received a massive increase in government funding to accelerate the development of their aerial technology which would become infamous throughout the course of the war.

However, The East Asian Empire only aligned with Eurasia out of convenience due to its geographical proximity. After defeating their common enemy, Japan ultimately sought to break away from Eurasia and assert its global domination.

In the meantime, both sides fought over the disputed territories in an effort to tip the balance of power. Over the years, each side tried to seize this region and push the other out. Thus, the UTA and the Eurasian-East Asian alliance launched a series of brutal campaigns in an attempt to capture the disputed territories for themselves.

The most intense battles occurred around the borders separating the disputed territories from the UTA, Eurasian and East-Asian controlled territories. This included the African, Chinese and Eastern European borders. These were the key regions where both sides fought the hardest for control.

However, the 14-year conflict ultimately ended in a stalemate. Prolonged warfare significantly drained the resources of all countries involved. Not only that, the Seekers Wars took a toll on morale on a global scale. Protests erupted around the world, demanding an end to the destruction and bloodshed. Civil unrest was on the verge of becoming a violent uprising against governments worldwide.

Worse, military forces on all sides grew tired of the war. One by one, the strategic bases of Eurasia, East Asia and the UTA descended into mutiny. With mounting pressure from the general population and growing military dissent within their own ranks, the world leaders finally relented.

In the year 2045, Eurasia, East Asia and the UTA signed the **Global** Seekers **Armistice**. This was a formal agreement with two fundamental objectives: for all parties to cease hostilities and negotiate long-term peace. This treaty paved the way for the **Battle** Seekers **Championship** that started in 2050.

During the next five years, the major global powers focused on recovering from the destruction and rebuilding their respective territories.

It was also during this time that Eurasia, East Asia and the UTA went through a long process of negotiating the terms of peace. In the end, all parties decided that a “friendly” global competition would be a more humane alternative to settle their disputes. The main incentives of such a competition were:

* Permanently ending the war (and the subsequent loss of life)
* Stimulating the post-war economy by generating jobs and international trade
* Establishing a new global industry that was mutually beneficial for all nations

Thus, the **Battle** Seeker**s Championship** was created in 2050.

While open warfare had officially ended, tensions were still high. As nations battled for skyward supremacy in this new global arena, a deep undercurrent of animosity remained between them.
