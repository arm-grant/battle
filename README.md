Official Battle Seekers Whitepaper

#### &#x20;<a href="#welcome-to-battle-drones" id="welcome-to-battle-drones"></a>

Battle Seekers is a start-up game development company, with our HQ in Auckland, New Zealand. We have a global team of game developers, partners and community members.

At the core of the business, we’re just a team of individuals that love gaming and having fun. We want to build a world for players, designed and owned by gamers.

Battle Seekers are building the next generation of immersive games, built by players, for players. We are developing a community of gamers that share the same vision for the potential of gaming and digital ownership.

By building our own ecosystem of games that tell the intricate narrative of Battle Seekers and the characters that dwell in this world, we create a truly immersive experience that combines different media formats and storytelling techniques.

We’re building our games on the Unity engine so we can easily expand to all gaming platforms, providing greater accessibility to our content. Our goal first and foremost is to create gaming experiences that our players can have fun in and have our community help craft these experiences along the way!
