# Enemy seekers

During your journey playing  blue screen Resistance, you will take on countless enemy seekers. There are many types of enemies in the game — with different weapons and skills. Therefore, it is worth being _well-prepared_ and choosing the right strategy for each type of opponent. Here's and introduction to some of the types of seekers that you will first encounter in-game.

This type of seeker attacks at close range with a baton. Since it is a short weapon, it’s advantageous to use a ranged weapon to defeat this seeker.

This seeker attacks with a laser weapon that is relatively fast and has a long range. The laser beam is visible, which makes their attacks more predictable and easier to avoid. However, when seekers attack in large groups it might become more difficult to avoid.

Heavy seeker is much more challenging than the previously highlighted seekers. It attacks the opponent at a closer range. Heavy seekers are equipped with special shields that increase defence and reduce damage taken. It also supports nearby seekers with a defensive aura, making them worthy opponents on the battlefield.

Spot an Exploding seeker nearby? It’s best to run! This seeker is equipped with bombs that can explode at any moment. Beware! If you come too close to it, your seeker’s HP might just take a massive hit!
