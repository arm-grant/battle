# Perks

In Red Rock Resistance, you can obtain perks during the game to boost your play style. Perks are special benefits that help you during battles with enemy drones.

A different icon represents a different perk that you can buy to obtain specific advantages. You can purchase perks using the drone parts you collect after destroying a hostile drone.

For example, you must collect 500 drone parts to buy the **Meteoroids** perk (which adds a 10% damage bonus).

_If you ever feel your life is in danger Solomon can guarantee you a second chance with his very own drone insurance._
