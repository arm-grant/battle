# Game Details

The initial release will consist of a round-based Player vs. Environment (PVE) mode “Onslaught”, which will test a player’s skill and determine if they have what it takes to enter the seeker Dome (_more on that later...)._

In this mode, players battle for survival as they fight off enemy seekers in waves of combat. Players will have an array of weapons at their disposal to eliminate a variety of enemy types. They’ll need to choose the right arsenal for the job and customise their seeker for optimal combat and handling. Finding the right balance is the key to avoiding catastrophic damage and surviving the onslaught. Will you be the last seeker standing… or get blown into oblivion?

Following the initial release on PC, we will immediately be pushing the game to mobile and console platforms. From there, updates will be added to introduce variety in the form of additional weapons, enemies and game modes. These include:

* CO-OP: a two-player 'Onslaught' mode
* Multiplayer Player vs. Player (PVP) game modes

The PVP game mode will appeal to a variety of gamers looking for social competition. Players will be able to test their skills, climb ranks in a leaderboard and earn in-game rewards. With a unique Match Making Rating (MMR) to ensure games are challenging and rewarding for players of all skill levels.
